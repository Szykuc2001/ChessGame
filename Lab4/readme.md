**Launch Instructions:**
1. Install sklearn, graphviz, pydotplus, matplotlib and pandas and download the Python files
2. After installing required dependencies run any python file, generated graphs should be located in the same directory as the code

**Analysis:**
Based on the accuracy of our Decision Tree and SVM for 1st dataset we can see, that SVM is more accurate than the tree.
Based on the accuracy of our Decision Tree and SVM for 2nd dataset we can see, that SVM is still more accurate than the tree by around 6%.
